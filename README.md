# Recommendation_System-GP-
The user enters more than input, and the system will get the file that contains data from the drive and classify it to get the number of positive, negative, and neutral samples for each file. A pie chart represents the percentage of the three classes for each input and recommends the file name that has a high ratio between the number of positive and negative samples.
# What did I do?
1: Collect a dataset with Egyptian language from multiple resources, such as:


    1.1 Google Maps
   
    1.2 Twitter
   
    1.3 Google Play


2: Apply preprocessing.


3: Apply machine learning models such as:

    3.1 SVM
   
    3.2 KNN
   
    3.3 Naive Bayes
   
    3.4 Decision Tree
   
    3.5 Random Forest
   
    3.7 Logistic Regression


4: Apply deep learning models such as:
   
    4.1 Forward Neural Network
   
    4.2 CNN


5: Apply Sequential models such as:

   
    5.1 RNN
   
    5.2 GRU
   
    5.3 LSTM

# Transfer Learning:
Used Transformers as a pre-trained model called "CAML based on Arabic sentiment analysis."

# Scraping:
Scrap tweets from Twitter about any input user entered by the Twitter API.

# GUI:
Stramlit library in Python instead of web development, as we wanted to make a website.
